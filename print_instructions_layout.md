# Print instructions – Book layout

This document describes the layout of the printed book (PDF) for the mosaic.

---

## 1. Cover

- First page: cover of the book with a **title**.

---

## 2. Overview

- **Total mosaic**
  - One view of the full mosaic.
  - Grid of **plates** (plate boundaries) visible.
  - Grid of **16×16 patches** visible.
- **Color summary**
  - List of each color used in the mosaic.
  - For each color: **total number** of patches (or tiles) needed across the whole mosaic.

---

## 3. One chapter per plate

Each plate gets its own chapter.

### 3.1 Chapter start – Plate overview

- Start of the chapter: **overview of that plate**.
- **General overview with current plate marked**: always show the full mosaic (same as the opening overview), with the **current plate highlighted or marked** so the reader can see where this chapter sits in the whole mosaic.
- **Color counts for this plate only**: for each color used on this plate, show how many patches are needed for this plate.

### 3.2 Chapter body – Single-color patch pages

- After the plate overview, the chapter continues with **patch pages**.
- **Per page**: up to **4** patches.
- Each patch is **single-color** (one color per patch; the 16×16 layout for that color on this plate).
- Pages are filled with up to 4 such patches until all patches for that plate are covered.

---

## 4. Final overview

- Before closing the book: a **final overview** page.
- Same as the opening overview (full mosaic with plate grid and 16×16 patch grid, total per-color counts), so the reader can refer back to the complete picture at the end.
